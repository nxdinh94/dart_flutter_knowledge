# Built-in types
- The Dart language has special support for the following:
    - Numbers (int, double)
    - Strings (String)
    - Booleans (bool)
    - Records ((value1, value2))
    - Functions (Function)
    - Lists (List, also known as arrays)
    - Sets (Set)
    - Maps (Map)
    - Runes (Runes; often replaced by the characters API)
    - Symbols (Symbol)
    - The value null (Null)

## Numbers
Dart numbers come in two flavors:
- `int`
- `double`
## String
- You can put the value of an expression inside a string by using `${expression}`.
- To create a multi-line string, use a triple quote with either single or double quotation marks: 
```dart
    var s1 = '''
    You can create
    multi-line strings like this one.
    ''';

    var s2 = """This is also a
    multi-line string.""";
```
- You can create a `raw` string by prefixing it with `r`:
```
    var s = r'In a raw string, not even \n gets special treatment.';
```





## Booleans

## Runes and grapheme clusters
